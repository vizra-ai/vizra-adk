Vizra ADK is a comprehensive Laravel package for building autonomous AI agents that can reason, use tools, and maintain persistent memory. Create intelligent, interactive agents that integrate seamlessly with your Laravel application.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 Multi-Model AI Support** - Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini + more, thanks to prism PHP
- **🎯 Sub-Agent Delegation** - Agents can delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents
- **🛠️ Extensible Tool System** - Give agents abilities to interact with databases, APIs, and external services
- **🧠 Persistent Memory** - Agents remember conversations and learn from interactions across sessions
- **🔄 Agent Workflows** - Build complex processes with sequential, parallel, conditional flows and loops
- **⚡ Execution Modes** - Multiple trigger modes: conversational, scheduled, webhook, event-driven, and queue jobs
- **📊 Evaluation Framework** - Automated quality testing framework for agents at scale with LLM-as-a-Judge
- **💬 Streaming Responses** - Real-time, token-by-token streaming for responsive user experiences
- **📈 Comprehensive Tracing** - Debug and monitor agent execution with detailed traces
- **🎨 Web Dashboard** - Beautiful Livewire-powered interface for testing and monitoring
- **🔧 Laravel Native** - Built with Laravel patterns: Artisan commands, Eloquent models, service providers

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install via Composer
composer require vizra/vizra-adk

# Publish config and run migrations
php artisan vizra:install

# Create your first agent
php artisan vizra:make:agent CustomerSupportAgent

# Start chatting!
php artisan vizra:chat customer_support
```

## 💻 Basic Usage

```php
<?php

use Vizra\VizraADK\Agents\BaseLlmAgent;
use Vizra\VizraADK\Facades\Agent;

// Define your agent
class CustomerSupportAgent extends BaseLlmAgent
{
    protected string $name = 'customer_support';
    protected string $description = 'Helps customers with inquiries';
    protected string $instructions = 'You are a helpful customer support assistant.';
    protected string $model = 'gpt-4o';

    protected array $tools = [
        OrderLookupTool::class,
        RefundProcessorTool::class,
    ];
}

// That's it! No registration needed - agents are auto-discovered

// Use your agent immediately
$response = CustomerSupportAgent::run('I need help with my order')
    ->forUser($user)
    ->go();
```

### Recording Message Feedback

Agent conversations now track whether an assistant reply was liked or disliked. When you have the message identifier (available from the persisted conversation history), call the facade helper to update or clear the feedback state:

```php
use Vizra\VizraADK\Facades\Agent;

Agent::setMessageFeedback($assistantMessageId, 'like');    // or 'dislike'
Agent::setMessageFeedback($assistantMessageId, null);      // clear feedback
```

Only assistant-role messages accept feedback. The reaction is stored in the `agent_messages.feedback` column and is included in `StateManager` conversation history entries alongside each message `id`.

## 🛠️ Creating Tools

Tools extend your agent's capabilities:

```php
use Vizra\VizraADK\Contracts\ToolInterface;
use Vizra\VizraADK\System\AgentContext;

class OrderLookupTool implements ToolInterface
{
    public function definition(): array
    {
        return [
            'name' => 'order_lookup',
            'description' => 'Look up order information',
            'parameters' => [
                'type' => 'object',
                'properties' => [
                    'order_id' => [
                        'type' => 'string',
                        'description' => 'The order ID',
                    ],
                ],
                'required' => ['order_id'],
            ],
        ];
    }

    public function execute(array $arguments, AgentContext $context): string
    {
        $order = Order::find($arguments['order_id']);

        return json_encode([
            'status' => 'success',
            'order' => $order->toArray(),
        ]);
    }
}
```
