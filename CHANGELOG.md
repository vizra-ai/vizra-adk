## [Unreleased]
## [0.0.34] - 2025-10-03

Add streaming state check in BaseLlmAgent
BaseLlmAgent now checks for a 'streaming' state in the context and sets the streaming property accordingly. This allows agents to be configured for streaming behavior based on context state.

## [0.0.33] - 2025-10-02

Add HTTP transport support for MCP clients
Introduces MCPHttpClient for HTTP/SSE transport and refactors MCPClientManager to support both STDIO and HTTP transports via MCPTransport enum. MCPClient is now deprecated in favor of MCPStdioClient, and a common MCPClientInterface is added. Configuration and tests are updated to support and verify HTTP transport functionality.

## [0.0.32] - 2025-10-01

Persist user messages with images and documents
Adds user messages, including images and documents, to the context for persistence after message preparation. This ensures that all relevant user input is retained for future reference.

## [0.0.31] - 2025-09-29

 Fixed issue where user ID wasn't assigned to session creation

Add configurable logging and global enable/disable support
Introduces a HasLogging trait for unified, configurable logging across the package, with support for log levels and component-specific toggles. Adds a global 'enabled' flag to the config to allow disabling the entire package, and updates all relevant services, providers, and tools to respect these settings. Includes comprehensive tests for package disabling and logging behavior.

Remove duplicate user message addition in BaseLlmAgent
Eliminates redundant addition of the user message with attachments in BaseLlmAgent, preventing duplicate user messages during execution. Adds unit tests to verify correct message deduplication and proper handling of conversation history and input.


## [0.0.30] - 2025-09-26

Add embedder and semanticRatio to Meilisearch driver
Introduces 'embedder' and 'semantic_ratio' configuration options for the Meilisearch vector driver. These are now included in search requests as part of the 'hybrid' parameter, and corresponding test coverage has been added.

Make MCPClient timeout configurable and add tests
Changed MCPClient to use a dynamic timeout based on configuration, replacing the fixed maxAttempts value. Added unit tests to verify correct timeout handling and calculation for various scenarios.

Make web route prefix configurable
Replaces the hardcoded 'vizra' route prefix with a value from the 'vizra-adk.routes.web.prefix' config, defaulting to 'vizra'. This allows customization of the route prefix via configuration.

## [0.0.29] - 2025-09-15

Add support for OpenAI stateful responses

## [0.0.28] - 2025-09-11

Update namespace conversion to use DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR for cross-platfor

Support array config for provider tools in BaseLlmAgent

## [0.0.27] - 2025-09-04

Fix provider enum handling in BaseLlmAgent


## [0.0.27] - 2025-09-04

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter Authentication Error**: Fixed issue where using `Provider::OpenRouter` enum directly in agent class properties caused authentication failures. The `getProvider()` method now properly handles both Provider enum instances and string values, allowing developers to use either approach.

### Changed
- Enhanced provider handling in `BaseLlmAgent` to support both string values (e.g., `'openrouter'`) and Provider enum instances (e.g., `Provider::OpenRouter`)

## [0.0.26] - 2025-09-04

üöÄ Enhanced Streaming Response Handling

  - Improved streaming functionality: Added intelligent buffering system that
  captures the complete response text while streaming
  - Context persistence: Streaming responses now properly update the agent
  context with the complete assistant message after streaming completes
  - Event dispatching: Added AgentResponseGenerated event firing for streaming
  responses
  - Trace completion: Proper trace span closure for streaming operations with
  success/error status

## [0.0.25] - 2025-08-29

Merge vizra-adk providers into prism config
Adds logic to merge providers from the vizra-adk configuration into the prism.providers config array if any are present. This ensures that all relevant providers are registered in the prism configuration.

## [0.0.24] - 2025-08-27

Optimize message persistence in StateManager
Refactored StateManager to only insert new messages instead of deleting and reinserting all messages on each save. Added tests to verify message persistence, prevent duplicates, handle long histories, and ensure correct incremental saving across sessions.

## [0.0.23] - 2025-08-26

Add tests for fileToClassName with Windows and Unix paths

Fix misplaced closing tag in trace-span partial

Enhanced ‚Å†afterLLmResponse Hook
- Added request parameter to the ‚Å†afterLLmResponse method‚Ä©
- Now receives both the original request and response objects‚Ä©
- Enables complete request-response pair logging for better debugging and monitoring

New ‚Å†onToolException Hook
- Introduced a new hook to handle exceptions during tool execution‚Ä©
- Provides centralized error handling for tool-related failures‚Ä©
- Allows for custom error recovery strategies and logging

New Event Types

‚Å†ToolCallFailed Event
- Emitted when a tool call encounters an error‚Ä©
- Includes error details, tool name, and input parameters‚Ä©
- Enables tracking of tool reliability and failure patterns
‚Å†LLmCallFailed Event

Add OpenRouter provider support


## [0.0.22] - 2025-08-23

encapsulate prims request creation as well as tool creation into their own methods

## [0.0.21] - 2025-08-20

Bug fix: Refactor VectorMemoryStore command parameter structure

## [0.0.20] - 2025-08-14

Add HTTP timeout config for LLM API requests
Introduces 'http' configuration options in vizra-adk.php for controlling timeout and connection timeout for LLM API calls. BaseLlmAgent now applies these settings to Prism requests to prevent premature timeouts.

## [0.0.19] - 2025-08-14



## [0.0.18] - 2025-08-14

Provider Tool Support
Added a providerTools property to BaseLlmAgent and a getProviderToolsForPrism() method to convert provider tool types to ProviderTool objects for use with Prism. [1] [2]
Updated the agent execution flow to include provider tools in the Prism request if any are configured.
Agent Configuration Improvements
Made the maximum number of agent steps (maxSteps) configurable via a class property, instead of hardcoding the value. [1] [2]
Conversation History Handling
Simplified the retrieval of conversation history by always converting collections to arrays, improving reliability.
Dependency Updates

dd CLAUDE.md and GitHub star prompt to install command

## [0.0.17] - 2025-07-28



## [0.0.16] - 2025-07-21

Added support for pseudo-terminal (PTY) mode and improved environment handling in MCPClient. Updated configuration to allow custom npx path and app directory access. Improved client connection management in MCPClientManager to handle stale clients and added use_pty option to server configs.

## [0.0.15] - 2025-07-14

Enhances agent tracing to support sub-agent delegation with parent trace context preservation and restoration. Updates the chat interface UI to display sub-agent info, improves typing indicator and send button logic, and adds polling for running traces. Refactors prompt versioning to support Blade templates, and adds feature/browser tests for chat interface behaviors.

Introduces JudgeBuilder to enable fluent, agent-based assertion syntax in evaluations. Updates BaseEvaluation to expose judge() and make recordAssertion public. Adds comprehensive unit tests for JudgeBuilder and its integration with BaseEvaluation. Removes obsolete MCPMakeAgentCommand.

Corrects the logic for determining the 'days' value in AgentTraceCleanupCommand. Now, the command only uses the config default if the 'days' option is not provided, ensuring explicit zero values are respected.

Qdrant and in-memory vector drivers have been removed from configuration, validation, and setup logic. Only 'pgvector' and 'meilisearch' are now supported for vector storage. Also, AgentTraceCommand now includes 'input', 'output', and 'metadata' in span output.

Introduces AgentVectorProxy to simplify agent vector memory operations, making vector and RAG methods public and context-aware. Adds GeminiEmbeddingProvider for Google Gemini embeddings. Updates VectorMemoryManager and related tools/tests to use agent class instead of agent name, streamlining method signatures and usage. Enhances Meilisearch driver with fallback similarity calculation. Updates configuration for vector memory and RAG features.
