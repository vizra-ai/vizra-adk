# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Message feedback support for assistant messages, including a `feedback` column on `agent_messages`, context propagation, and the `Agent::setMessageFeedback()` helper.
## [0.0.29] - 2025-09-15

Add support for OpenAI stateful responses

## [0.0.28] - 2025-09-11

Update namespace conversion to use DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR for cross-platfor

Support array config for provider tools in BaseLlmAgent

## [0.0.27] - 2025-09-04

Fix provider enum handling in BaseLlmAgent


## [0.0.27] - 2025-09-04

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter Authentication Error**: Fixed issue where using `Provider::OpenRouter` enum directly in agent class properties caused authentication failures. The `getProvider()` method now properly handles both Provider enum instances and string values, allowing developers to use either approach.

### Changed
- Enhanced provider handling in `BaseLlmAgent` to support both string values (e.g., `'openrouter'`) and Provider enum instances (e.g., `Provider::OpenRouter`)

## [0.0.26] - 2025-09-04

  - Context persistence: Streaming responses now properly update the agent
  context with the complete assistant message after streaming completes
  - Event dispatching: Added AgentResponseGenerated event firing for streaming
  responses
  - Trace completion: Proper trace span closure for streaming operations with
  success/error status

## [0.0.25] - 2025-08-29

Merge vizra-adk providers into prism config
Adds logic to merge providers from the vizra-adk configuration into the prism.providers config array if any are present. This ensures that all relevant providers are registered in the prism configuration.

## [0.0.24] - 2025-08-27

Optimize message persistence in StateManager
Refactored StateManager to only insert new messages instead of deleting and reinserting all messages on each save. Added tests to verify message persistence, prevent duplicates, handle long histories, and ensure correct incremental saving across sessions.

## [0.0.23] - 2025-08-26

Add tests for fileToClassName with Windows and Unix paths

Fix misplaced closing tag in trace-span partial

Enhanced ‚Å†afterLLmResponse Hook
- Added request parameter to the ‚Å†afterLLmResponse method‚Ä©
- Now receives both the original request and response objects‚Ä©
- Enables complete request-response pair logging for better debugging and monitoring

New ‚Å†onToolException Hook
- Introduced a new hook to handle exceptions during tool execution‚Ä©
- Provides centralized error handling for tool-related failures‚Ä©
- Allows for custom error recovery strategies and logging

New Event Types

‚Å†ToolCallFailed Event
- Emitted when a tool call encounters an error‚Ä©
- Includes error details, tool name, and input parameters‚Ä©
- Enables tracking of tool reliability and failure patterns
‚Å†LLmCallFailed Event
- Emitted when an LLM API call fails‚Ä©
- Contains error information, request details, and failure context‚Ä©
- Facilitates monitoring of LLM service health and error rates

Add OpenRouter provider support


## [0.0.22] - 2025-08-23

encapsulate prims request creation as well as tool creation into their own methods

## [0.0.21] - 2025-08-20

Bug fix: Refactor VectorMemoryStore command parameter structure

## [0.0.20] - 2025-08-14

Add HTTP timeout config for LLM API requests
Introduces 'http' configuration options in vizra-adk.php for controlling timeout and connection timeout for LLM API calls. BaseLlmAgent now applies these settings to Prism requests to prevent premature timeouts.

## [0.0.19] - 2025-08-14



## [0.0.18] - 2025-08-14

Provider Tool Support
Added a providerTools property to BaseLlmAgent and a getProviderToolsForPrism() method to convert provider tool types to ProviderTool objects for use with Prism. [1] [2]
Updated the agent execution flow to include provider tools in the Prism request if any are configured.
Agent Configuration Improvements
Made the maximum number of agent steps (maxSteps) configurable via a class property, instead of hardcoding the value. [1] [2]
Conversation History Handling
Simplified the retrieval of conversation history by always converting collections to arrays, improving reliability.
Dependency Updates

dd CLAUDE.md and GitHub star prompt to install command

## [0.0.17] - 2025-07-28



## [0.0.16] - 2025-07-21

Added support for pseudo-terminal (PTY) mode and improved environment handling in MCPClient. Updated configuration to allow custom npx path and app directory access. Improved client connection management in MCPClientManager to handle stale clients and added use_pty option to server configs.

## [0.0.15] - 2025-07-14

Enhances agent tracing to support sub-agent delegation with parent trace context preservation and restoration. Updates the chat interface UI to display sub-agent info, improves typing indicator and send button logic, and adds polling for running traces. Refactors prompt versioning to support Blade templates, and adds feature/browser tests for chat interface behaviors.

Introduces JudgeBuilder to enable fluent, agent-based assertion syntax in evaluations. Updates BaseEvaluation to expose judge() and make recordAssertion public. Adds comprehensive unit tests for JudgeBuilder and its integration with BaseEvaluation. Removes obsolete MCPMakeAgentCommand.

Corrects the logic for determining the 'days' value in AgentTraceCleanupCommand. Now, the command only uses the config default if the 'days' option is not provided, ensuring explicit zero values are respected.

Qdrant and in-memory vector drivers have been removed from configuration, validation, and setup logic. Only 'pgvector' and 'meilisearch' are now supported for vector storage. Also, AgentTraceCommand now includes 'input', 'output', and 'metadata' in span output.

Introduces AgentVectorProxy to simplify agent vector memory operations, making vector and RAG methods public and context-aware. Adds GeminiEmbeddingProvider for Google Gemini embeddings. Updates VectorMemoryManager and related tools/tests to use agent class instead of agent name, streamlining method signatures and usage. Enhances Meilisearch driver with fallback similarity calculation. Updates configuration for vector memory and RAG features.


## [0.0.14] - 2025-07-13

Updates

## [0.0.13] - 2025-07-11

Adds granular control over agent conversation history via new context strategy and filtering in BaseLlmAgent. Refactors Livewire ChatInterface to provide separate context state, session, and long-term memory data for improved UI display. Updates JSON viewer and chat interface Blade templates for better layout, scrolling, and modal handling. Renames attachment docs and updates README and example usage to use run() instead of ask()
