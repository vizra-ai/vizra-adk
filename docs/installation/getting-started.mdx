<Info>
Building AI agents has never been easier! In just a few steps, you'll have your own intelligent agent up and running.
</Info>

## Installation via Composer

Let's kick things off! First, we'll add Vizra ADK to your Laravel project:

```bash Terminal
composer require vizra/vizra-adk
```

## Running the Install Command

Now let's set everything up with our magical installation command:

```bash Terminal
php artisan vizra:install
```

<Tip>
This command publishes config, runs migrations, sets up the web interface, and creates example agents to get you started!
</Tip>

## Setting Up Your AI Provider

Before your agents can start thinking, they need access to an AI provider. Add your preferred AI provider's API key to your `.env` file:

```bash .env
# Choose one (or add multiple!)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### Which Provider Should I Choose?

- **OpenAI:** Great all-around choice, GPT-4 for complex tasks, GPT-3.5 for speed
- **Anthropic:** Claude excels at analysis, writing, and following instructions
- **Google:** Gemini offers great performance and generous free tier

Don't worry - you can switch providers anytime or use different ones for different agents!

<Note>
Vizra ADK supports 10+ AI providers through [Prism PHP](https://github.com/echolabsdev/prism), including DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, and more. [See all providers](/api-reference/providers)

## 5-Minute Quick Start: Build a Smart Assistant

Let's build something real! In just 5 minutes, you'll create an intelligent FAQ assistant that can answer questions about your product.

### Step 1: Create the Agent

```bash Terminal
php artisan vizra:make:agent ProductAssistant
```

Agent created at `app/Agents/ProductAssistant.php`

### Step 2: Configure Your Agent

Open the agent file and give it some personality and knowledge:

```php app/Agents/ProductAssistant.php
<?php

namespace App\Agents;

use Vizra\VizraADK\Agents\BaseLlmAgent;

class ProductAssistant extends BaseLlmAgent
{
    protected string $name = 'product_assistant';

    protected string $description = 'Helps users understand our product features and pricing';

    protected string $instructions = "You are a helpful product assistant for AcmeApp.

        Key product information:
        - AcmeApp is a project management tool for teams
        - Pricing: Free for up to 5 users, $10/user/month for larger teams
        - Features: Task management, team collaboration, time tracking, reporting
        - Integrations: Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar

        Be friendly, concise, and always try to be helpful. If you don't know
        something, be honest about it.";

    // Use GPT-3.5 for quick responses
    protected string $model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo';
    protected ?float $temperature = 0.7;
}
```

### Step 3: Test Your Agent

You have three ways to test your new agent:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Command Line">
    ```bash Terminal
    php artisan vizra:chat product_assistant
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Web Interface">
    Visit `http://your-app.test/vizra` for a beautiful chat interface with trace debugging!
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API Endpoints">
    **OpenAI-Compatible** (use with any OpenAI tool!):
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://your-app.test/api/vizra-adk/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "product_assistant",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is AcmeApp?"}]
      }'
    ```

    **Native Vizra API**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://your-app.test/api/vizra-adk/interact \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"agent_name": "product_assistant", "input": "What is AcmeApp?"}'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
The web interface is perfect for development - you can see traces, debug tool calls, and test conversations visually!
</Tip>

### Step 4: Use in Your Application

Use your assistant within Laravel:

```php routes/web.php
use App\Agents\ProductAssistant;

$response = ProductAssistant::run($request->input('message'))
    ->forUser(auth()->user())
    ->go();
```

<Tip>
Your agent automatically maintains conversation history per user!
</Tip>

## Congratulations! You Did It!

In just 5 minutes, you've created an AI assistant that can answer questions about your product. But this is just the beginning! Your agent can do so much more:

- Add **custom tools** to let it search databases, send emails, or call APIs
- Delegate tasks to **sub agents**
- Enable **vector memory** to give it knowledge from your documentation
- Create **workflows** to handle complex multi-step processes
- Run **evaluations** to ensure quality at scale

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### "Invalid API Key" or "Unauthorized" Errors

This is the most common issue! Here's how to fix it:

1. Check your `.env` file has the correct API key (no extra spaces!)
2. Clear config cache: `php artisan config:clear`
3. Verify the API key is active in your provider's dashboard
4. For OpenAI: Ensure you have billing set up (even for free tier)

### "Agent Not Found" Errors

- Make sure your agent class extends `BaseLlmAgent`
- Agent file must be in `app/Agents/` directory
- Class name must match filename (PSR-4 autoloading)
- Run `composer dump-autoload` if needed

### Database/Migration Issues

If you see database errors:

```bash Terminal
# Reset and re-run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh
php artisan vizra:install
```

<Warning>
This will reset your database! Use with caution in production.
</Warning>
