```php app/Agents/CustomerSupportAgent.php
<?php

namespace App\Agents;

use Vizra\VizraADK\Agents\BaseLlmAgent;
use App\Tools\OrderLookupTool;
use App\Tools\RefundProcessorTool;

class CustomerSupportAgent extends BaseLlmAgent
{
    protected string $name = 'customer_support';

    protected string $description = 'Helpful customer support assistant';

    protected array $tools = [
        OrderLookupTool::class,
        RefundProcessorTool::class,
    ];

    protected function getSystemPrompt(): string
    {
        return "You are a helpful customer support assistant. " .
               "Be friendly, professional, and solution-oriented.";
    }
}
```

<Tip>
That's it! This agent can now have intelligent conversations, look up customer orders, and process refunds - all while maintaining context and providing helpful responses. The framework handles all the complex AI orchestration for you!
