## What is Laravel Boost?

Laravel Boost is an AI-powered development assistant from the Laravel team that understands your project's structure and helps you write better code faster. Vizra ADK integrates seamlessly with Boost through a comprehensive guideline system.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Laravel Boost

First, ensure you have Laravel Boost installed in your project:

```bash Terminal
composer require laravel/boost --dev
```

### 2. Install Vizra ADK Guidelines

Run the Boost installation command from your Vizra ADK package:

```bash Terminal
php artisan vizra:boost:install
```

This command copies the Vizra ADK guidelines to your project's `resources/boost/guidelines` directory.

### 3. Start Using Boost with Vizra ADK

Now Laravel Boost understands your Vizra ADK agents and can help you:

- Generate new agents with proper structure and naming
- Create tools that implement the correct interface
- Build complex workflows with the Workflow facade
- Implement memory and context management
- Write evaluations and assertions
- Debug and troubleshoot common issues

## Example Usage

Ask Laravel Boost to help you create a Vizra ADK agent:

<Note>
**Example prompt:**

"Create a customer support agent that uses memory to track conversation context and can search our knowledge base"
</Note>

Laravel Boost will generate a complete agent with proper inheritance, tool implementation, and memory configuration based on the Vizra ADK guidelines.
